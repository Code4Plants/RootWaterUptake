# RootWaterUptake
Matlab files for the solution of a coupled soil-root water transport of a
simple root stretch with variable hydraulic properties over length

Main file is run.m whith calls to: 
RootStretch   = Iterated matrix method of solution,                
Bvpsuite2      =  DAE type reference solution using BVPSuite. Install BVPsuite from  https://github.com/NumODEsTUW/bvpsuite2.0.       
Tested with Matlab R2020a Update 6
